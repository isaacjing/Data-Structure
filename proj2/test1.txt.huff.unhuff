Your task is to write two programs, one titled huff.c and the other titled unhuff.c.  
The program huff.c should accept one argument, which will be the name of an input file. 
The program should compress the input file using Huffman coding and write out the compressed output to a file that has the same name as the input file with a .huff appended to it. 
For example, if example.txt is the name of an input file, the output file should be example.txt.huff. 
The program unhuff.c should accept one argument, which will be the name of an input file. 
The program should de-compress the input file and write out the de-compressed output to a file that has the same name as the input file with an .unhuff appended to it. 
For example, if example.txt.huff is the name of an input file, the output file should be example.txt.huff.unhuff.
